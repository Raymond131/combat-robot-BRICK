Single-fork lifter arm driven by a servo with parallelogram linkage\
Unibody chassis with threaded inserts for mounting the lid, bringing mechanical strength with easy printing\
PU belt driven four wheel drive, using only two motors to save weight\
Integrated full-width front wedge with full wheel guards for a robust defence\
